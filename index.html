          I was born in Amoy, China. A city which very close to Taiwan.
          Therefore I can speak both Mandarin and Taiwanese. Like other
          teenagers I am addicted to video games, it is the part of the reason
          that I choose IT as my major in University. I am a team player and
          always like to make new friends online over the world so I prefer
          muti-player games. I am also a fan of cycling, it is a convenient
          transport for my hometown because Amoy is a small Island.

        <p class="mg-t15">
          My interest in information technology began during my junior year of
          high school in 2013. In the meantime, I broke my knees when playing
          the basketball. The only thing I can do is stay at home and have rest.
          I started browsing different kind of informations from plenty web
          pages when feel tired of gameplay. I was facinated with how the
          Internet worked. The reason of choose to come to RMIT is quite simple.
          I needed the Bachelor degree and I had a career goal. My aunt said
          graduates of RMIT have a higher employment rate than other
          universities. Consequently, study IT at RMIT may offer numerous
          opportunities to me. I think practical skill is the biggest part of
          studying IT. I am expecting to develop the ability of building
          functional web pages and coding a video game.

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in
            the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees.
            Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather,
            it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and
            actions to push the limits of social convention. Adventurers enjoy
            upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and
            behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase
            “Don’t box me in!”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mg-t30">
          <label class="subheader positive" style="font-weight: 800">
            Strengths
          </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            Charming – People with the Adventurer personality type are relaxed
            and warm, and their “live and let live” attitude naturally makes
            them likable and popular.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Sensitive to Others – Adventurers easily relate to others’ emotions,
            helping them to establish harmony and good will, and minimize
            conflict.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Imaginative – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer
            personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold ideas that
            speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to explain this quality on
            a resume, this vivid imagination and exploratory spirit help
            Adventurers in unexpected ways.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Passionate – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an intensely
            feeling heart. When people with this personality type are caught up
            in something exciting and interesting, they can leave everything
            else in the dust.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Curious – Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to see and
            explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true. Work revolving
            around the sciences may seem a poor match for their traits, but a
            boldly artistic and humanistic vision is often exactly what research
            needs to move forward – if Adventurers are given the freedom they
            need to do so.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Artistic – Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible
            ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing a song, painting an
            emotion, or presenting a statistic in a graph, Adventurers have a
            way of visualizing things that resonates with their audience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mg-t30">
          <label class="subheader negative" style="font-weight: 800">
            Weaknesses
          </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            Fiercely Independent – Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’
            top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions
            and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer
            personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics and
            work a challenge.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Unpredictable – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and
            plans. The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can
            cause strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial
            hardship later in life.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Easily Stressed – Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion.
            When situations get out of control, people with this personality
            type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their
            characteristic charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Overly Competitive – Adventurers can escalate small things into
            intense competitions, turning down long-term success in their search
            for glory in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Fluctuating Self-Esteem – It’s demanded that skills be quantified,
            but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity and
            artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful and
            damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start to
            believe the naysayers without strong support.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Artistic – Adventurers are able to show their creativity in tangible

            Extraversion – Medium Characteristics
          </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            You have a medium level of extraversion. This means that at times,
            you get your energy from being around others; but at other times,
            you get your energy by being alone. Life is all about balance, and
            for you, it’s important to spend time alone and with others. You
            don’t mind being the center of attention at times, but you don’t
            seek out ways to be the center of attention either.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            Because you have traits of both an introvert and extravert, you know
            when to speak up and when to stay silent. You are able to recognize
            the times when you need to speak up and be assertive, and can find
            the courage to have those difficult conversations when necessary.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            Jobs for those who are moderately extraverted include those that
            allow building relationships with others, but also allow periods of
            time to work alone. The best jobs for these individuals include
            counseling, human resources, or being a director.

          <p class="mg-t15">
            You scored medium in agreeableness. Others often describe you as
            friendly and helpful. You typically try to avoid conflict, but when
            a situation arises, you aren’t afraid to speak up. In group
            situations, you are able to find a comfortable balance between
            keeping everyone happy, but also speaking up and making the right
            decision.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            You are a fairly generous person, and enjoy doing what you can to
            help others. In your free time, you may find yourself volunteering
            or helping friends and family with various projects. You believe
            helping others is important, but have not felt the need to devote
            your entire life to helping others. You do what you can to help,
            while making sure you are not being taken advantage of.

            You scored medium on conscientiousness. At times, you are very
            driven and hard-working, but that doesn’t mean you don’t like to
            have fun! You are always able to set a comfortable balance between

            Neuroticism – Medium Characteristics

            You are moderately neurotic – at times, you can be anxious or

          </p>

            You describe yourself as a realist. You don’t tend to be overly

            clearly and realistically, considering many factors.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            Your neurotic traits – such as worrying about how you are perceived
            by others – make you successful in your career. Coupled with your
            ability to remain level-headed, you have a great balance of traits
            to be a natural leader. You try to do your best at everything, even
            if there doesn’t seem to be anything in it for you. People who are

            Openness to Experience – Low Characteristics

          <p class="mg-t15">
            You are low in openness to experience. People who are low in
            openness to experience are typically very dedicated to any work they
            do, and always make sure to see their tasks through to the end. You
            are not very artistic or imaginative, and do not see the value in
            unnecessary things like art and music.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            You are very analytical, and are able to think quickly to solve any
            problem you are faced with. Your first instinct is to use
            tried-and-true methods when solving problems.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            You tend to see things as black-and-white. You believe that people

            believe that someone’s personal traits and choices play a bigger

        <p class="mg-t15 mg-lr-15">
          An interesting problem to tackle is how art history is taught in
          schools. Students think of art history as a boring and difficult
          subject to learn since they need to memorize and understand facts,
          concepts, and historical events (Mz & Sy 2008). A solution to this
          problem is to improve how art history is taught by letting students
          experience the art itself during its creation, this is possible by
          developing a 3D game using Unity. Creating a game comprising the life
          of each artist that’s part of the syllabus in an art history class
          will take time since the developer would also need to study each era
          in art history. A game that would let students explore each era and
          experience how to create the artwork will allow students to learn
          through experience. This will be useful at some point in someone’s
          life who’s currently taking up an art history class. Since it is
          considered that art history is a boring and difficult subject to learn
          and a way to make it entertaining and easier to learn is to create a
          game-based application that would address the problems that students
          are encountering while studying art history.

          The game could be composed of minigames, and the life of each artist
          would be discussed in every minigame. The minigames would be varying
          puzzle games depending on the artwork being discussed. It could be a
          game that would let you paint, sculpt, or a puzzle game that would
          help teach the life of the artist and the details of the artist's
          artwork. The game will also let you interact with the model of an
          artist as the NPC of each minigame, and let you learn as if being
          there with the artist. Each minigame would be separated into different
          rooms or areas and the design of each room and area would depend on
          where the artwork is created. As the game progresses, the player would
          be able to explore each era in chronological order as if being part of
          the era while playing the game. For example, a level of a game could
          be the life of Leonardo da Vinci then the room or area will be similar
          to where Leonardo da Vinci might have painted the Mona Lisa. An
          example playthrough is when the player starts the game, the player
          would be able to enter the first level of the game. Upon entering the
          first level, the player would encounter the artist of a specific era.
          The player would be able to talk to the artist and the player would
          need to solve a puzzle to move to the next level. The puzzle could be
          a painting game if the artwork is a painting, this would allow the
          player to experience how the painting is formed, what style is used,
          and techniques involved to complete the painting. After completing the
          minigame, the player will talk to the artist and there will be a
          dialogue about how the artist lived during the time and talk more
          about the artwork. This will be the same for every room or area,
          except for the type of minigame, artist, and design of the area or
          room. Upon completion of all the eras, the player is expected to learn
          about the life and artwork of every artist the player encountered in
          the game.

          Creating a 3D game like this requires skills in game design, game
          development, and research on learning theories. Furthermore, studying
          game engines like Unity may also be needed when developing games
          depending on the developer’s preference. Studying Unity would not be
          that difficult because there are available resources online that can
          be found although basic knowledge on how to write C# code is a must
          when using Unity since you’ll need to write C# code when creating
          scripts for the game. It is easy to find tutorials on how to develop a
          3D game, and the documentation of Unity is straightforward so it would
          be easy to implement each function that might be useful to the
          development of a game. Of course, to develop a game with Unity, you’ll
          need to use their Unity editor. The Unity editor is a powerful editor
          made by Unity that would allow the development of games based on the
          Unity game engine. Creating the worlds or areas of the game is
          possible with the use of the Unity editor since there are open source
          tools available in Unity and assets that are free to download.
          Although, you’ll need to use another software such as Blender to
          create models of the artist that will be used in the game. Blender is
          free to download from their website and use it to make your models.
          Blender is not beginner-friendly, but there are a lot of tutorials
          that can be found online. A computer with sufficient processing power
          to run 3D games and Unity is enough and it wouldn't need any special
          hardware to develop this game. Lastly, to make the game effective,
          research on several learning theories would be helpful, and
          incorporating it into the minigames may yield a better result when
          students try to play the game as a supplement for their art history
          class.

          If the project is successful, students who take up art history will
          just play the game as a supplement for their class. It could motivate
          students to take up art history more seriously and help them
          understand the art movement and style of each era’s artwork much
          easier and learn the life of the artist as if being taught by the
          artist itself. The development of this game may impact the way how
          other subjects/courses are taught. This could push game developers and
          designers to create more game-based learning applications that could
          assist schools or universities in teaching difficult subjects, it may
          also affect the difficulty of learning a subject and push students to
          be confident in their class as they can study at their own pace and
          enjoy learning the subject without being intimidated of learning a
          difficult topic. class.
