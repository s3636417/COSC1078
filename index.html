          I was born in Amoy, China. A city which very close to Taiwan.
          Therefore I can speak both Mandarin and Taiwanese.
          Like other teenagers I am addicted to video games,
          it is the part of the reason that I choose IT as my major in University.
          I am a team player and always like to make new friends online over
          the world so I prefer muti-player games. I am also a fan of cycling,
          it is a convenient transport for my hometown because Amoy is a small Island.

        <p class="mg-t15">
          My interest in information technology began during my junior year of high school in 2013. In the meantime,
          I broke my knees when playing the basketball. The only thing I can do is stay at home and have rest.
          I started browsing different kind of informations from plenty web pages when feel tired of gameplay.
          I was facinated with how the Internet worked. The reason of choose to come to RMIT is quite simple.
          I needed the Bachelor degree and I had a career goal. My aunt said graduates of RMIT have a higher
          employment rate than other universities. Consequently, study IT at RMIT may offer numerous opportunities
          to me. I think practical skill is the biggest part of studying IT. I am expecting to develop the ability
          of building functional web pages and coding a video game.

          <label class="subheader"> Type Indicator </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not
            necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out
            painting happy little trees. Often enough though,
            they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s
            that they use aesthetics, design and even their
            choices and actions to push the limits of social
            convention. Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional
            expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior –
            chances are, they’ve expressed more than once
            the phrase “Don’t box me in!”
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mg-t30">
          <label class="subheader positive" style="font-weight: 800"> Strengths </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            Charming – People with the Adventurer personality
            type are relaxed and warm, and their “live and let live”
            attitude naturally makes them likable and popular.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Sensitive to Others – Adventurers easily relate to others’
            emotions, helping them to establish harmony and good will,
            and minimize conflict.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Imaginative – Being so aware of others’ emotions, Adventurer
            personalities use creativity and insight to craft bold
            ideas that speak to people’s hearts. While it’s hard to
            explain this quality on a resume, this vivid imagination
            and exploratory spirit help Adventurers in unexpected ways.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Passionate – Beneath Adventurers’ quiet shyness beats an
            intensely feeling heart. When people with this personality
            type are caught up in something exciting and interesting,
            they can leave everything else in the dust.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Curious – Ideas are well and good, but Adventurers need to
            see and explore for themselves whether their ideas ring true.
            Work revolving around the sciences may seem a poor match for
            their traits, but a boldly artistic and humanistic vision is
            often exactly what research needs to move forward – if
            Adventurers are given the freedom they need to do so.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Artistic – Adventurers are able to show their creativity
            in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing
            a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a
            graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that
            resonates with their audience.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mg-t30">
          <label class="subheader negative" style="font-weight: 800"> Weaknesses </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            Fiercely Independent – Freedom of expression is often Adventurers’
            top priority. Anything that interferes with that, like traditions
            and hard rules, creates a sense of oppression for Adventurer
            personalities. This can make more rigidly structured academics
            and work a challenge.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Unpredictable – Adventurers’ dislike long-term commitments and plans.
            The tendency to actively avoid planning for the future can cause
            strain in Adventurers’ romantic relationships and financial hardship
            later in life.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Easily Stressed – Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion.
            When situations get out of control, people with this personality
            type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic
            charm and creativity in favor of gnashing teeth.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Overly Competitive – Adventurers can escalate small things into intense
            competitions, turning down long-term success in their search for glory
            in the moment, and are unhappy when they lose.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Fluctuating Self-Esteem – It’s demanded that skills be quantified,
            but that’s hard to do with Adventurers’ strengths of sensitivity
            and artistry. Adventurers’ efforts are often dismissed, a hurtful
            and damaging blow, especially early in life. Adventurers can start
            to believe the naysayers without strong support.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t15">
            Artistic – Adventurers are able to show their creativity
            in tangible ways and with stunning beauty. Whether writing
            a song, painting an emotion, or presenting a statistic in a
            graph, Adventurers have a way of visualizing things that
            resonates with their audience.

          <label class="subheader"> Extraversion – Medium Characteristics </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            You have a medium level of extraversion. This means that at times,
            you get your energy from being around others; but at other times,
            you get your energy by being alone. Life is all about balance, and
            for you, it’s important to spend time alone and with others. You don’t
            mind being the center of attention at times, but you don’t seek out ways
            to be the center of attention either.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            Because you have traits of both an introvert and extravert, you know
            when to speak up and when to stay silent. You are able to recognize
            the times when you need to speak up and be assertive, and can find
            the courage to have those difficult conversations when necessary.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            Jobs for those who are moderately extraverted include those that
            allow building relationships with others, but also allow periods
            of time to work alone. The best jobs for these individuals include
            counseling, human resources, or being a director.

        <div class="mg-t30">
          <label class="subheader"> Agreeableness – Medium Characteristics </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            You scored medium in agreeableness. Others often describe you
            as friendly and helpful. You typically try to avoid conflict,
            but when a situation arises, you aren’t afraid to speak up.
            In group situations, you are able to find a comfortable balance
            between keeping everyone happy, but also speaking up and making
            the right decision.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            You are a fairly generous person, and enjoy doing what you
            can to help others. In your free time, you may find yourself
            volunteering or helping friends and family with various projects.
            You believe helping others is important, but have not felt the
            need to devote your entire life to helping others. You do what
            you can to help, while making sure you are not being taken advantage of.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="mg-t30">
          <label class="subheader"> Conscientiousness – Medium Characteristics </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            You scored medium on conscientiousness. At times, you are very driven
            and hard-working, but that doesn’t mean you don’t like to have fun!
            You are always able to set a comfortable balance between work and fun.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            Your home isn’t spotless, but it is clean and organized.
            You don’t mind leaving a mess behind when you are in a hurry,
            but you make sure to clean it up later.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            Your conscientious traits make you successful in your career –
            you are very reliable and hard-working. This, along with your
            friendly and relaxed personality, makes you a great employee to
            have. You finish what is expected of you, but aren’t too busy
            working to build relationships with your coworkers and supervisors.

          <label class="subheader"> Neuroticism – Medium Characteristics </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            You are moderately neurotic – at times, you can be anxious or
            emotional, while at other times, you are relaxed and calm.
            Your mood may fluctuate slightly, depending on the day.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            You describe yourself as a realist. You don’t tend to be
            overly optimistic or overly pessimistic, and are able
            to view problems clearly and realistically, considering many factors.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            Your neurotic traits – such as worrying about how you are
            perceived by others – make you successful in your career.
            Coupled with your ability to remain level-headed, you have a
            great balance of traits to be a natural leader. You try to do
            your best at everything, even if there doesn’t seem to be
            anything in it for you. People who are moderate in neuroticism
            make great employees and supervisors.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            People who are moderately neurotic typically do well
            in helping careers, such as counseling or public service.

          <label class="subheader"> Openness to Experience – Low Characteristics </label>
          <p class="mg-t15">
            You are low in openness to experience. People who are low in openness
            to experience are typically very dedicated to any work they do,
            and always make sure to see their tasks through to the end. You
            are not very artistic or imaginative, and do not see the value in
            unnecessary things like art and music.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
            You are very analytical, and are able to think quickly to
            solve any problem you are faced with. Your first instinct is
            to use tried-and-true methods when solving problems.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            You tend to see things as black-and-white. You believe that
            people usually do not change, and people are either good or
            bad. You believe that someone’s personal traits and choices
            play a bigger role than luck or circumstance.
          </p>

          <p class="mg-t10">
            People who are low in openness to experience often are well-suited
            for careers that allow them to have daily routines, with job duties
            that are very clear. For example, you may be well-suited for a job
            in finance, mechanics, or technology.

            To summarize the above, I am great at finding exciting
            new things to explore and experience. My creativity and
            down-to-earth attitude are invaluable in many areas,
            including my own personal growth.
          </p>
          <p class="mg-t10">
